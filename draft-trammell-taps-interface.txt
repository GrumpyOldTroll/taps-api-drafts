     An Abstract Application Layer Interface to Transport Services
                  draft-trammell-taps-interface-latest

Abstract

   This document describes an abstract programming interface to the
   transport layer, following the Transport Services Architecture.  It
   supports the asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages over
   transport protocols and network paths dynamically selected at
   runtime.  It is intended to replace the traditional BSD sockets API
   as the lowest common denominator interface to the transport layer, in
   an environment where endpoints have multiple interfaces and potential
   transport protocols to select from.

1.  Introduction

   The BSD Unix Sockets API's SOCK_STREAM abstraction, by bringing
   network sockets into the UNIX programming model, allowing anyone who
   knew how to write programs that dealt with sequential-access files to



Trammell, et al.         Expires August 5, 2018                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft               TAPS Interface                February 2018


   also write network applications, was a revolution in simplicity.  It
   would not be an overstatement to say that this simple API is the
   reason the Internet won the protocol wars of the 1980s.  SOCK_STREAM
   is tied to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), specified in 1981
   [RFC0793].  TCP has scaled remarkably well over the past three and a
   half decades, but its total ubiquity has hidden an uncomfortable
   fact: the network is not really a file, and stream abstractions are
   too simplistic for many modern application programming models.

   In the meantime, the nature of Internet access, and the variety of
   Internet transport protocols, is evolving.  The challenges that new
   protocols and access paradigms present to the sockets API and to
   programming models based on them inspire the design principles of a
   new approach, which we outline in Section 3.

   As a first step to realizing this design, [TAPS-ARCH] describes a
   high-level architecture for transport services.  This document builds
   a modern abstract programming interface atop this architecture,
   deriving specific path and protocol selection properties and
   supported transport features from the analysis provided in [RFC8095]
   and [TAPS-MINSET].

2.  Terminology and Notation

   This API is described in terms of Objects, which an application can
   interact with; Actions the application can perform on these objects;
   Events, which an object can send to an application asynchronously;
   and Parameters associated with these Actions and Events.

   The following notations, which can be combined, are used in this
   document:

   o  Object := Action()



         An Action creates an Object.

   o  Object.Action()



         An Action is performed on an Object.

   o  Object -> Event<>

Internet-Draft               TAPS Interface                February 2018


         An Object sends an Event.

   o  Action(parameter, parameter, ...) / Event<parameter, parameter,
      ...>



         An Action takes a set of Parameters; an Event contains a set of
         Parameters.

   Actions associated with no object are Actions on the abstract
   interface itself; they are equivalent to actions on a per-application
   global context.

   How these abstract concepts map into concrete implementations of this
   API in a given language on a given platform is largely dependent on
   the features of the language and the platform.  Actions could be
   implemented as functions or method calls, for instance, and Events
   could be implemented though via callback passing or other
   asynchronous calling conventions.

3.  Design Principles

   We begin with a set of initial design principles for the abstract
   interface to realize.

   o  Transport protocol stack independence in line with the Transport
      Services Architecture [TAPS-ARCH], allowing applications to be
      written in terms of the semantics best for the application's own
      design, separate from the protocol(s) used on the wire to achieve
      them.  This enables applications written to a single API to make
      use of transport protocols in terms of the features they provide.

   o  Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport
      protocols.

   o  Explicit support for security properties as first-order transport
      features, and for long-term caching of cryptographic identities
      and parameters for associations among endpoints.

   o  Atomic transmission of content, using application-assisted framing
      and deframing where the underlying transport does not provide
      these.

   o  Asynchronous connection establishment, transmission, and
      reception, allowing most application interactions with the
      transport layer to be event-driven.

4.  API Summary

   [TASK: write three paragraph summary here, should state how all this
   works for common cases from the application's PoV.]

   In the following sections, we describe the details of application
   interaction with Objects through Actions and Events in each phase of
   a connection, following the phases described in [TAPS-ARCH].

5.  Pre-Establishment Phase

   Establishment begins with the creation of a Connection...

   Connection := NewConnection(remoteSpecifier, transportParameters,
   cryptographicParameters)

5.1.  Resolving Remote Endpoints

   [TASK: write me. note: resolution should be flexible, and should
   accept URLS and URL-like things. binding to transport or
   pseudotransport happens via pre-establishment properties. resolution
   happens as part of connection creation.]

5.2.  Specifying Transport Parameters

   [TASK: write me. list parameters to bind to a connection before
   establishing it. look at minset for this. note that the API should
   have sensible and well-defined defaults.]

5.3.  Specifying Cryptographic Parameters

   [TASK: write me. separate out cryptographic parameters, since these
   bind to a local and a remote. chris?]

6.  Establishing Connections

6.1.  Active Open: Initiate

   Connection.Initiate()

   Connection -> Ready<>

6.2.  Passive Open: Listen

   Connection.Listen()

   Connection -> ConnectionReceived<remoteSpecifier>

Internet-Draft               TAPS Interface                February 2018


6.3.  Peer to Peer Establishment: Rendezvous

   Connection.Rendezvous()

   Connection -> Ready<>

6.4.  Connection Groups

7.  Sending Data

   Connection.Send(Content, ...)

   Connection -> Sent<>

   Connection -> SendError<>

7.1.  Send Parameters

7.2.  Sender-side Framing over Stream Protocols

   Connection.FrameWith(Framer)

   Octets := Framer.Frame(Content)

8.  Receiving Data

   Connection -> Received<Content>

   Connection -> ReceiveError<>

8.1.  Receiver-side Deframing over Stream Protocols

   Connection.DeframeWith(Deframer)

   Content := Deframer.Deframe(OctetStream)

9.  Connection Termination

   Connection.Close()

   Connection -> Finished<>

   Connection.Abort()

   Connection -> ConnectionError<>
